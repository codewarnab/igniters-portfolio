# Portfolio Customization Guide

Welcome to the **Igniters Club** workshop! This guide will help you customize this portfolio template to make it your own.

## 🚀 How to Customize This Portfolio

This project is designed to be easily editable. You don't need to be an expert in HTML/CSS to personalize it.

### Step 1: Open the Project
Open the `index.html` file in VS Code.

### Step 2: Preview the Website
**Option A: Using Live Server (Recommended)**
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
3. The website will launch in your browser and auto-update when you save.

**Option B: Double/Right Click**
1. Go to your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.
3. Refresh the page manually after making changes.

### Step 3: Find Customizable Sections
We have marked all the editable sections with clear comments.
Press `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on Mac) to open the search bar and type:

`EDIT HERE`

### Step 3: Make Your Changes
Cycle through the search results to find each section. You will see comments like this:

```html
<!-- ================= EDIT HERE: YOUR NAME ================= -->
<h1 class="home__name">Chris Evans</h1>
```

Simply replace the text inside the HTML tags with your own details.
**Example:**
```html
<h1 class="home__name">John Doe</h1>
```
